Private,David Clark,40.0,1837-01-07,Saturday,Gunfire,"Texas Rangers, Texas",Texas,6 months,,Rifle,,"In late 1836, the Republic of Texas ordered the creation of three ranging companies to protect the inhabitants living on the frontier from marauding Indians. Company B of the Texas Rangers under the command of Captain Thomas H. Barron was stationed at Fort Milam near present days Falls County. A scout reported Indian tracks about 12 miles from the fort. Sergeant George B. Erath led 10 rangers and three civilian volunteers who located the Indians camped on high ground at a bend of Elm Creek, not far from present day Rosebud, in Cameron County. As daylight approached on January 7, the rangers left their horses tied and crept to within rifle range of the Indian camp. Erath counted about 100 Indians. When a camp dog wandered toward the rangers, Erath decided to attack. The initial shots killed or wounded several Indians, but the Indians soon discovered they had numerical superiority and moved to out flank the rangers. Private David Clark and volunteer Frank Childers were wounded. During the battle Sergeants Erath and McLochlan found the wounded Clark. McLochlan’s gun was broken and Clark offered him his gun. McLochlan refused and ran up the gully towards the other rangers. Erath stayed a little longer with Clark who was then sinking, but he left as he saw a dozen Indians approaching. When the rangers returned later they found that Clark had been scalped and his hands cut off. The body of Childers was found sitting against a tree, dead from a gunshot wound. This incident was known as the “Fight at Elm Creek.”David Clark enlisted in Colonel Burleson’s Ranging Corps of Mounted Riflemen, serving in Captain Hill’s company, on July 3, 1836 and served until September 11, 1836 when he transferred to Captain Barron’s Company B. Clark was reportedly from Lincoln County, Missouri, son of Captain Christopher Clark. Erath described Clark as an “elderly man.”Private Clark was survived by his wife and son."

Private,John B. Walters,24.0,1839-02-25,Monday,Gunfire,"Texas Rangers, Texas",Texas,1 week,,Rifle,,"A band of 200-300 Comanche warriors were raiding communities in central Texas near present day Bastrop. Twenty-five volunteers organized a ranger company and elected Jacob Burleson as their captain. Three other Burleson brothers joined the company – Jonathan, John and Aaron. Another brother was Edward Burleson who was the colonel of the frontier range forces. Another volunteer company of twenty-seven men commanded by Captain James Rogers, a brother-in-law of Burleson, joined the campaign. The ranger companies spotted the Indians near Brushy Creek and the Indians started racing for a thicket. The rangers tried to cut them off from the thicket. When the rangers dismounted, the Indians charged. Captain Burleson saw a young ranger, aged 14; jump on his horse without untying it. Burleson ran back and untied the boy’s horse. Racing to own horse, Burleson was just mounting the saddle when he was shot in the back of the head. Burleson reeled and fell from his saddle. The Indians fell upon Burleson’s body with a vengeance thinking they had killed Colonel Edward Burleson.Colonel Edward Burleson arrived with an additional thirty rangers. Both sides started sniping at each other. Privates Edward Blakey and John B. (Jack) Walters were shot in the head and killed outright. Private James Gilleland was shot in the neck, the ball going down through his lungs. He would survive for 10 days and die on March 7. Colonel Edward Burleson reported that probably thirty Indians were killed. Jacob Burleson’s father was an early founder of Stephen F. Austin's colony in Texas in 1823. His parents had 12 children. He was 36 years old at the time of his death. He was survived by his pregnant wife and two children. His wife had a son two months after his death and the child was named after him.   Edward Blakey was single and was survived by his widowed mother. It is unknown what his age was at the time of his death. His father and brother had both been killed fighting for Texas independence.John B. (Jack) Walters, 24, had come to Texas from Missouri in 1825, and had worked as a carpenter, gunsmith, and a ranger in Texas. He was single and was survived by his widowed mother.  Reverend James Gilleland, 40, was an organizer of the first Methodist Church in Stephen F. Austin’s little colony in 1834. No information on whether he was married or had any children. The State of Texas has recognized the sacrifice of these volunteers who formed a ranger company to protect the frontier. In 1925, a red marker was placed on private property about 1.4 miles south of Taylor on Highway 95 in Williamson County to honor the rangers killed in the battle.  The Texas Historical Commission erected a marker commemorating the “Battle of Brushy Creek"" on State Highway 95, four miles south of Taylor and named the four men killed in the battle."
First Sergeant,William H. Weaver,21.0,1839-05-26,Sunday,Gunfire,"Texas Rangers, Texas",Texas,2 months,,Rifle,,"Continuing Indian raids caused settlers on the upper Brazos, Trinity and Colorado rivers to petition the Congress of the Republic of Texas for help. On Sunday, May 26, 1839, Captain John Bird and Private Nathaniel Brookshire encountered three Indians skinning a buffalo and routed them, capturing one of their horses laden with meat.  Around 9:00 a.m., a small party of Indians busily chasing a herd of buffalo and sighted the rangers at the supposedly abandoned Fort Smith.   At 1:00 p.m., Captain Bird and 35 rangers tried to catch up with the Indians who remained just outside of rifle range. The rangers charged, but to no avail, and decided to retreat. At that point the rangers were surrounded by 40 Indians. The rangers dismounted and walked their horses into the ravine (later named Bird's Creek). Private H. M. C. Hall persisted in remaining on horseback, and he was mortally wounded while dismounting on the bank. Smoke signals were sent and 200 Indians arrived from the Comanche, Caddo and Kickapoo tribes. The Indians charged several times, but were repulsed by the rangers’ accurate fire. In the battle, Private Thomas Gay fell dead in the ditch from a rifle ball; Private Jesse E. Nash was shot and killed by an arrow; First Sergeant William H. Weaver was killed by a rifle ball to the head; and Second Lieutenant William R. Allen and Private George W. Hensel were severely wounded. As the Indian fell back a second time, Captain Bird jumped up on the bank to encourage his men and was shot through the heart by an arrow launched by an Indian at the extraordinary distance of 200 yards. Just at dark Comanche War Chief Buffalo Hump and 12 warriors charged the rangers. The war chief was killed and the Indians withdrew. The rangers reported to have killed about 30-40 Indians and wounded about as many.

The Regulators were organized to “regulate” cattle rustling and crime through vigilante justice. The Moderators were organized to “moderate” the vigilante actions of the Regulators.  Campbell was appointed sheriff in late 1840 after the elected sheriff resigned. William Pinckney Rose, known as “Captain Rose,” was the leader of the Regulators. Two of his men, George W. Rembert and Isaac Hughes, organized a posse to capture two thieves, but it was a trap set by Moderators. Rembert was shot and killed and the others fled. Shortly afterwards, a posse led by Sheriff Campbell found Hughes and ordered him to surrender. Hughes refused and Sheriff Campbell ordered the posse to fire. Hughes was killed in the volley. Hughes’ brother sought revenge and was assisted by Captain Rose. On January 23, 1841, Sheriff Campbell was assassinated in Port Caddo by Hughes’ brother and perhaps Captain Rose. Robert Potter, the leader of the Moderators, had Rose charged with murdering Sheriff Campbell and two other men. The President of the Republic of Texas put a reward of $500 for the arrest and conviction of Rose for murdering Sheriff Campbell while he was in the discharge of his official duties. Potter formed a posse and attempted to arrest Rose and collect the reward on March 1, 1842. Rose was hidden by his slaves and escaped capture. On March 2, 1842 Captain Rose formed a posse and surrounded Potter’s cabin. Potter decided to attempt to escape across the lake and was shot and killed. Potter’s wife filed charges against Rose and nine posse members, but cases were dismissed in 1843.

On August 5, 1841, Ranger Captain Eli Chandler, like the other commanders on the northern frontier of the Republic of Texas, believed there was a major Indian village somewhere on the upper Brazos or Trinity. Chandler's Robertson County Rangers met the Milam County Minute Men, led by Captain George Erath, at the lone village Captain Chandler had just discovered. The Rangers moved up the Brazos River, but they found no trace of any Indian settlement or camp, and the expedition camped on the upper edge of the Cross Timbers, their supplies exhausted.During the wait, Indians were seen near the ranger camp and Captain Erath. Twenty men went to track them. He split his party into two squads, and one of them soon picked up a fresh trail. Following these prints, Captain Erath came upon a party of either Cherokee or Kickapoo, who opened fire at close range from atop a rock cliff, killing Private A. T. Smith, and grazing several other men. Ranger sniping killed two Indians and may have wounded others. The other ranger squad arrived, having heard the shots, and shortly reinforcements came in from the main ranger camp. A ranger charge carried the cliff, but the Indians slipped away in the woods, taking their dead and wounded. Private Smith’s brother and nephew served on the same expedition and carried his body away from the battlefield to bury him in an unmarked grave. Smith had enlisted on Aug. 2, 1841 in the Milam County Minute Men and served only 3 days before being killed. He was survived by his wife, Elsie Parks Smith, and six children.

Cortina, the heir to a large land grant in the lower Rio Grande valley that included the area around Brownsville, witnessed the city marshal pistol-whipping an intoxicated Mexican citizen who had previously been employed by the Cortina family. Cortina shot the marshal in the shoulder and fled on his horse with the prisoner. On September 28, 1859, Cortina and 60-100 men rode into Brownsville intent on seeking revenge for numerous grievances. The bandits killed a local merchant and George Morris, who may have been a constable. Cameron County Jailer Robert L. Johnson refused to release the prisoners, and instead, fired at the group, killing one of the raiders. Johnson and a citizen were killed in the fusillade that followed. Cortina later withdrew back into Mexico.Texas Governor Runnels authorized Captain William G. Tobin to raise a company of 100 rangers from San Antonio to quell the lawlessness in Brownsville. On November 16, a detachment of thirty rangers under the command of Lt. John Littleton spotted a band of Cortinistas about a mile from Palo Alto and pursued them into the chaparral. The rangers dismounted, tied their horses to some scrubby mesquite, and charged into the dense brush. In the vicious fight that lasted only thirty minutes, Ranger Privates Thomas Grier, William McKay and Nicholas R. Milett were killed, and four others badly wounded, including Lt. Littleton. Private John Fox surrendered to the Cortinistas and was executed. The day after the Palo Alto fight the rangers rode to the scene where they found the stripped and mutilated bodies of the dead rangers. The men were buried on the battlefield. By early December a second company of 120 rangers arrived as did 165 regular army troops. On December 14, army troops and rangers defeated about 400 men under Cortina in the battle of Rio Grande City. Ranger Private David Herman of Tobin’s company was mortally wounded.On February 4, 1860, Cortina appeared at La Bolsa, a large bend on the Rio Grande about 35 miles above Brownsville, where he attempted to capture the steamboat Ranchero. Army troops and rangers arrived and in the fighting Ranger Private Fountain B. Woodruff was mortally wounded. He handed his revolver to a fellow ranger and said, Take it. I shall never be able to use it again.Virtually no personal information is known about the rangers, except that William McKay was 19 years of age and Fountain B. Woodruff was 22 years of age.

When the posse reached the homestead, they were told the wanted person was not there. There are several different accounts as to what started the shooting, but the newspaper accounts stated the posse searched the house and as they were leaving, they were fired upon. The shooting left Deputy Sheriff Edward Faust and Posseman Henry Woods dead and at least one other person wounded. The next day the Sheriff, with a posse, went back to the Kerlick house and arrested Christopher and William F. Kerlick, and started back to Clinton under guard. The two young men allegedly attempted to escape, and were shot by the guard and both killed. The ironic twist is that Christopher Kerlick was no-billed by the Harris County Grand Jury two days before shooting, but this information was unknown to the lawmen. This communication failure cost the lives of 4 men. Edward Faust was reported to have been 30 years old and a native of Germany. His place of burial has not been located. It is unknown if he had any surviving family members.Henry Woods was 53 years of age and a former Captain in the Confederate Army. He was survived by his wife.

Hazlett offered no resistance, and on Birdwell’s command called to Grayson in a nearby store.When Grayson drew near, Hazlett told him, “I am a prisoner.” Grayson said, “Die before you surrender.” Deputized Citizen Harvell then demanded Hazlett hand over his gun. Instead, Hazlett drew his weapon and shot Harvell in the chest. But Harvell did not go down. He staggered though a nearby store door, picked up a shotgun, and fired the first barrel into Hazlett’s face. Hazlett was hit by only a few pellets, but the second barrel discharged in the direction of Grayson, wounding him. Hazlett and Grayson returned fire, twice hitting Harvell, who dropped dead on the store floor. Constable Birdwell never had a chance to draw his weapon, and was looking down the barrels of the state policemen’s guns when they mounted their horses and rode off.On December 19, 1871, Constable John Birdwell answered a knock on his door in Linn Flat and was shot dead. Arrest warrants were issued for Grayson and Hazlett. About a week later Lt. Thomas Williams, a respected member of the state police, rode into Linn Flat with Grayson and Hazlett. Lt. Williams negotiated with Sheriff Orton for several days over the arrest and confinement of the two state policemen. No settlement was reached, and Williams rode away one night with his two prisoners.

Feeling between the two factions broke into open warfare in 1870. In 1872, Charles Howard tried to claim ownership of the salt flats. This act outraged local citizens who seized Howard and released him on bond if he left the state. On October 10, 1877, Howard returned and killed a rival political leader. On November 11, 1877, Lt. John B. Tays took command of newly organized Company C of the state ranger forces. Howard was arraigned for the murder and admitted to bail. He was being guarded at some abode houses the rangers were using as quarters in San Elizario. A mob gathered and a detachment of U.S. troops soon arrived, but were told by the mob to mind their own business, so the troops returned to El Paso. The mob roped former El Paso County Sheriff Charles Ellis, who was a Howard associate, and dragged him through the streets, slashed him to death with knives, and mutilated his corpse. On December 13, John Atkinson, an ex-El Paso police lieutenant and San Elizario businessman, managed to get through the mob and into the ranger quarters with a trunk containing about $11,000. Ranger Sergeant C. E. Mortimer was walking between the buildings when a single shot from a sniper passed through his body.

Atkinson offered the mob the $11,000 to save Howard and Ranger Sergeant John E. McBride, who had been acting as Howard's agent in San Elizario prior to his enlistment.

The last of the “Billy the Kid” bunch, Jesse Evans, John Gross (alias Gunter) and three of the Davis brothers, had sacked the town and headed to Fort Davis. Evans  had escaped from jail and was wanted in New Mexico for murder. Captain Roberts dispatched a sergeant and several rangers to Fort Davis. They arrested some county officials and put some rangers in charge of the jail. The rangers received word that four members of the gang was on the road near Presidio del Norte, an old town on the Rio Grande River. Two sergeants, Edward A. Sieker and L. B. Caruthers, four privates, R. R. Russell, D. T. Carson, S. A. Henry and George Bingham, and Presidio County deputy sheriff Olito Herredia, started in pursuit of the gang. After a discussion to pursue the outlaws into Mexico if necessary, Private Bingham reportedly told Sergeant Caruthers, “Sergeant, I guess I’ll be in Mexico or hell before night.” Shortly after noon on July 3, 1880 they spotted the outlaws a mile ahead of them, and the men fled to a canyon gulch ahead of the rangers and dismounted.

Private Bingham was shot in the chest and killed. The remaining outlaws surrendered.  The rangers summoned a coroner who arrived on July 4. Since the remains of the dead men could not be moved, they buried Davis and Bingham by the side of the road between Fort Davis to Presidio del Norte, 18 miles from the Rio Grande River. Bingham was given a Ranger funeral with three volleys fired over his grave. One account states the citizens of Fort Davis gave the rangers reward money and promised to bury Bingham in the city. On October 15, 1880 John Gross (alias Gunter) was convicted and sentenced to a long term in the state penitentiary, but served only three or four years. Jesse Evans received 10 years in prison.

Gillespie established the camp for Company E at Toyah, west of the county seat at Pecos. Captain Gillespie learned that the sheriff drank heavily and was prone to frequent outbursts.

The sheriff became upset that the rangers were watching his movements to prevent serious trouble. The sheriff got more drunk and was walking the streets with a cocked six-shooter. Citizens complained to Captain Gillespie who ordered Sergeant L. F.

He began to stagger and, five seconds later came to the realization, exclaiming, “Oh, I’m shot!” A citizen, James Stamp, saw this and went to Patrolman Riley who told him to examine his revolver thinking that it was the one that had discharged. Stamp advised that all the cartridges were intact and then helped the wounded officer to Johnson’s Saloon, across the street from White’s. Stamp suggested he call for a wagon and Patrolman Riley said, “No, the wagon is coming .” As officers came from the now empty White’s Saloon, they found Patrolman Riley wounded at Johnson’s Saloon and rode with him to the Hammond Street Stationhouse and then to Central Station where he was met by Police Surgeon Armstrong. Dr. Armstrong cut the bullet out of his back, but determined the wound to be likely fatal having traversed front to back and through his intestines. Patrolman Riley was then removed to City Hospital and officers were sent to retrieve his aged mother.  On March 8, 1887, at 6:20 p.m., he passed away from acute peritonitis, surrounded by close friends and relatives. Patrolman Riley had served with the agency for nearly a year and half and was survived by his mother.  He is buried at St. Joseph's (New) Cemetery in Price Hill."

Private,Robert E.

Garza was a Texas resident who was well known as a newspaper editor and charismatic orator. Despite having almost 1,000 men under his command, his three attempts to invade Mexico failed and caused President Diaz to complain that the United States enforce its neutrality laws. The Garzistas challenged the U.S. Army on the federal level and Texas Rangers and county officers domestically. In February 1892 Garza slipped out of the U.S. and fled to Central America. The Garzistas became bandits and wanted men. On March 20 several bandits were caught by Company E and one was killed. On March 22, Ranger Private Robert E. Doaty was ambushed and killed by the bandits. Doaty was with seven or eight rangers who came upon a band of Garzistas about 20 miles below Pena, on the Duval-Starr county line. Doaty was shot in the head and killed instantly. The rangers captured one horse and one horse was killed. No rangers were injured.Texas Ranger enlistment papers report that Robert E. Doaty joined Company E of the Texas Rangers on March 1, 1892 in Alice, Texas and served for only 21 days before he was killed. Census records and contemporary newspaper accounts report his last name as Doughty; however, his enlistment papers show he joined as Doaty. He was born around 1860 and was about 34 years of age. He was apparently not married since his mother, Elizabeth Gravis, signed for his pay of $22. His place of burial is unknown at this time, but most likely he was buried in the family plot at the San Diego Cemetery in Duval County near his mother and stepfather."

Ranger Fuller arrested a man causing trouble and was trying to get him to jail on December 21, 1899, when he was jumped by another man. Either the prisoner, Denny Moore, was part of the gang, or Fuller’s attacker just hated any authority; whatever the reason the Ranger was attacked with a knife and had to shoot his assailant in self-defense. The slain man was identified as Oscar Poole, one of the gang leaders. Poole was a son of Orange County Judge George F. Poole. Ranger Fuller was arrested and jailed without bail; however, he was cleared in the shooting. The Poole family filed a complaint of false arrest in Orange County against Ranger Fuller over the death of Oscar Poole. Ranger Captain Bill McDonald protested that the charge was nothing more than a ploy to get the Fuller back in Orange, but he was overruled by superiors acutely concerned with maintaining good will. Captain McDonald and Private A. L. Saxon were in Orange as witnesses in a case involving newly promoted Lieutenant Fuller. During a break in the trial, Fuller and Saxon decided to get a shave. At 5:30 p.m. Fuller was standing in Adams’ barber shop washing his face at a basin in the center of the room when the shot was fired. The ball from a Winchester struck him in the back of the head and exited through his eye. Fuller fell to the floor and expired in a few minutes.
